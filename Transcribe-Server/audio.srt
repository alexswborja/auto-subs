389
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,000
Yes,

390
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,660
here we are.

391
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,720
It's really fun.

392
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:41,780
So,

393
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,040
you know, one cold

394
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,300
message on Instagram can bring

395
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,160
you somewhere quite far.

396
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,900
Yeah.

397
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,980
This is actually one advice.

398
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,520
If you want more money,

399
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,340
you can send

400
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,056
messages to production houses.

401
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:57,880
You know,

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,140
cold message can work actually.

403
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,380
Were you cold messaging before you

404
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,860
had upskilled and specialized or

405
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,560
did you work with them and

406
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,320
then learn that they needed this?

407
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,800
So for a bit of story,

408
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,480
I started as...

409
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,160

410
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,300

00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,960
you a cold Instagram message about,

414
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,120
I don't know, four days ago.

415
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,360
